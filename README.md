# My Portfolio Web Page

Web page is hosted [here](https://straces1.github.io/portfolio/)

This project is my personal web page. It has been created by Vite, I have actually finally swapped from create-react-app.

However this web portfolio has been created by ReactJS, using Chakra UI component framework. The contact form is powered by Formik and uses Yup as a validation schema. By filling the form and clicking the send button, if the filled data are valid, EmailJS will send me that data via email. 

Web application os fully responsive, so mobile version is available too. Both version contain theme switcher activated by clicking on the moon or sun icon, depending on actual theme. It represents single page application, so it does not contain any routes, user can navigate page by scrolling or click on navigation link will scroll down to the particular section.
